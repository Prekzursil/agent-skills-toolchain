# Vercel Deploy

Deploy any project to Vercel instantly. **Always deploy as preview** (not production) unless the user explicitly asks for production.

## Prerequisites

- When sandboxing blocks the deployment network calls, rerun with `sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`.
- The deployment might take a few minutes. Use appropriate timeout values.

## Quick Start

**Just run this (with a 10 minute timeout):**
```bash
vercel deploy [path] -y
```

**Important:** Use a 10 minute (600000ms) timeout for the deploy command since builds can take a while.

If that fails with "No existing credentials found", use the fallback method below.

## Fallback (No Auth)

If CLI fails with auth error, use the deploy script:

```bash
# Deploy current directory
bash scripts/deploy.sh

# Deploy specific project
bash scripts/deploy.sh /path/to/project

# Deploy existing tarball
bash scripts/deploy.sh /path/to/project.tgz
```

The script handles framework detection, packaging, and deployment. It waits for the build to complete and returns JSON with `previewUrl` and `claimUrl`.

**Tell the user:** "Your deployment is ready at [previewUrl]. Claim it at [claimUrl] to manage your deployment."

## Production Deploys

Only if user explicitly asks:
```bash
vercel deploy [path] --prod -y
```

## Output

Show the user the deployment URL. For fallback deployments, also show the claim URL.

**Do not** curl or fetch the deployed URL to verify it works. Just return the link.

## Troubleshooting

### Escalated Network Access
