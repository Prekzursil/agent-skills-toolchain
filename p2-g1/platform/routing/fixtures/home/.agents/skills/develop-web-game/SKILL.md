description: "Use when Codex is building or iterating on a web game (HTML/JS) and needs a reliable development + testing loop: implement small changes, run a Playwright-based test script with short input bursts and intentional pauses, inspect screenshots/text, and review console errors with render_game_to_text."

# Develop Web Game

Build games in small steps and validate every change. Treat each iteration as: implement → act → pause → observe → adjust.

## Skill paths (set once)

```bash
export CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
export WEB_GAME_CLIENT="$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js"
export WEB_GAME_ACTIONS="$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/references/action_payloads.json"
```

User-scoped skills install under `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (default: `~/.codex/skills`).

## Workflow

1. **Pick a goal.** Define a single feature or behavior to implement.
2. **Implement small.** Make the smallest change that moves the game forward.
3. **Ensure integration points.** Provide a single canvas and `window.render_game_to_text` so the test loop can read state.
4. **Add `window.advanceTime(ms)`.** Strongly prefer a deterministic step hook so the Playwright script can advance frames reliably; without it, automated tests can be flaky.
5. **Initialize progress.md.** If `progress.md` exists, read it first and confirm the original user prompt is recorded at the top (prefix with `Original prompt:`). Also note any TODOs and suggestions left by the previous agent. If missing, create it and write `Original prompt: <prompt>` at the top before appending updates.
6. **Verify Playwright availability.** Ensure `playwright` is available (local dependency or global install). If unsure, check `npx` first.
7. **Run the Playwright test script.** You must run `$WEB_GAME_CLIENT` after each meaningful change; do not invent a new client unless required.
