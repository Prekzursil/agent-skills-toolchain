# skill-stocktake

Slash command (`/skill-stocktake`) that audits all Claude skills and commands using a quality checklist + AI holistic judgment. Supports two modes: Quick Scan for recently changed skills, and Full Stocktake for a complete review.

## Scope

The command targets the following paths **relative to the directory where it is invoked**:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `~/.claude/skills/` | Global skills (all projects) |
| `{cwd}/.claude/skills/` | Project-level skills (if the directory exists) |

**At the start of Phase 1, the command explicitly lists which paths were found and scanned.**

### Targeting a specific project

To include project-level skills, run from that project's root directory:

```bash
cd ~/path/to/my-project
/skill-stocktake
```

If the project has no `.claude/skills/` directory, only global skills and commands are evaluated.

## Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Duration |
|------|---------|---------|
| Quick Scan | `results.json` exists (default) | 5–10 min |
| Full Stocktake | `results.json` absent, or `/skill-stocktake full` | 20–30 min |

**Results cache:** `~/.claude/skills/skill-stocktake/results.json`

## Quick Scan Flow

Re-evaluate only skills that have changed since the last run (5–10 min).

1. Read `~/.claude/skills/skill-stocktake/results.json`
2. Run: `bash ~/.claude/skills/skill-stocktake/scripts/quick-diff.sh \
         ~/.claude/skills/skill-stocktake/results.json`
   (Project dir is auto-detected from `$PWD/.claude/skills`; pass it explicitly only if needed)
