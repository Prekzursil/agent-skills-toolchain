# Deploy to Render

Render supports **Git-backed** services and **prebuilt Docker image** services.

This skill covers **Git-backed** flows:
1. **Blueprint Method** - Generate render.yaml for Infrastructure-as-Code deployments
2. **Direct Creation** - Create services instantly via MCP tools

Blueprints can also run a **prebuilt Docker image** by using `runtime: image`, but the `render.yaml` still must live in a Git repo.

If there is no Git remote, stop and ask the user to either:
- Create/push a Git remote (can be minimal if only the Blueprint is needed), or
- Use the Render Dashboard/API to deploy a prebuilt Docker image (MCP cannot create image-backed services).

## Prerequisites

- When sandboxing blocks the deployment network calls, rerun with `sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`.
- The deployment might take a few minutes. Use appropriate timeout values.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when users want to:
- Deploy an application to Render
- Create a render.yaml Blueprint file
- Set up Render deployment for their project
- Host or publish their application on Render's cloud platform
- Create databases, cron jobs, or other Render resources

## Happy Path (New Users)

Use this short prompt sequence before deep analysis to reduce friction:
1. Ask whether they want to deploy from a Git repo or a prebuilt Docker image.
2. Ask whether Render should provision everything the app needs (based on what seems likely from the user's description) or only the app while they bring their own infra. If dependencies are unclear, ask a short follow-up to confirm whether they need a database, workers, cron, or other services.
