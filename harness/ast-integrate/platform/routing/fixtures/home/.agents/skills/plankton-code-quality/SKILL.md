# Plankton Code Quality Skill

Integration reference for Plankton (credit: @alxfazio), a write-time code quality enforcement system for Claude Code. Plankton runs formatters and linters on every file edit via PostToolUse hooks, then spawns Claude subprocesses to fix violations the agent didn't catch.

## When to Use

- You want automatic formatting and linting on every file edit (not just at commit time)
- You need defense against agents modifying linter configs to pass instead of fixing code
- You want tiered model routing for fixes (Haiku for simple style, Sonnet for logic, Opus for types)
- You work with multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, Shell, YAML, JSON, TOML, Markdown, Dockerfile)

## How It Works

### Three-Phase Architecture

Every time Claude Code edits or writes a file, Plankton's `multi_linter.sh` PostToolUse hook runs:

```
Phase 1: Auto-Format (Silent)
├─ Runs formatters (ruff format, biome, shfmt, taplo, markdownlint)
├─ Fixes 40-50% of issues silently
└─ No output to main agent

Phase 2: Collect Violations (JSON)
├─ Runs linters and collects unfixable violations
├─ Returns structured JSON: {line, column, code, message, linter}
└─ Still no output to main agent

Phase 3: Delegate + Verify
├─ Spawns claude -p subprocess with violations JSON
├─ Routes to model tier based on violation complexity:
│   ├─ Haiku: formatting, imports, style (E/W/F codes) — 120s timeout
│   ├─ Sonnet: complexity, refactoring (C901, PLR codes) — 300s timeout
│   └─ Opus: type system, deep reasoning (unresolved-attribute) — 600s timeout

### What the Main Agent Sees
### Config Protection (Defense Against Rule-Gaming)
### Package Manager Enforcement
### Setup
### Quick Start
### Clone Plankton into your project (or a shared location)
### Note: Plankton is by @alxfazio
### Install core dependencies
### Install Python linters
### Start Claude Code — hooks activate automatically
