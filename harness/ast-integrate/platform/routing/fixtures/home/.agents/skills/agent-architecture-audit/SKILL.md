# Agent Architecture Audit

A diagnostic workflow for agent systems that hide failures behind wrapper layers, stale memory, retry loops, or transport/rendering mutations.

## When to Activate

**MANDATORY for:**
- Releasing any agent or LLM-powered application to production
- Shipping features with tool calling, memory, or multi-step workflows
- Agent behavior degrades after adding wrapper layers
- User reports "the agent is getting worse" or "tools are flaky"
- Same model works in playground but breaks inside your wrapper
- Debugging agent behavior for more than 15 minutes without finding root cause

**Especially critical when:**
- You've added new prompt layers, tool definitions, or memory systems
- Different agents in your system behave inconsistently
- The model was fine yesterday but is hallucinating today
- You suspect hidden repair/retry loops silently mutating responses

**Do not use for:**
- General code debugging — use `agent-introspection-debugging`
- Code review — use language-specific reviewer agents
- Security scanning — use `security-review` or `security-review/scan`
- Agent performance benchmarking — use `agent-eval`
- Writing new features — use the appropriate workflow skill

## The 12-Layer Stack

Every agent system has these layers. Any of them can corrupt the answer:

| # | Layer | What Goes Wrong |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | System prompt | Conflicting instructions, instruction bloat |
| 2 | Session history | Stale context injection from previous turns |

### Common Failure Patterns
### 1. Wrapper Regression
### 2. Memory Contamination
### 3. Tool Discipline Failure
### 4. Rendering/Transport Corruption
### 5. Hidden Agent Layers
### Audit Workflow
### Phase 1: Scope
### Phase 2: Evidence Collection
### Tool requirements expressed only in prompt text (not code)
### Tool execution without validation
