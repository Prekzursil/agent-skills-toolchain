# Autonomous Loops Skill

Patterns, architectures, and reference implementations for running Claude Code autonomously in loops. Covers everything from simple `claude -p` pipelines to full RFC-driven multi-agent DAG orchestration.

## When to Use

- Setting up autonomous development workflows that run without human intervention
- Choosing the right loop architecture for your problem (simple vs complex)
- Building CI/CD-style continuous development pipelines
- Running parallel agents with merge coordination
- Implementing context persistence across loop iterations
- Adding quality gates and cleanup passes to autonomous workflows

## Loop Pattern Spectrum

From simplest to most sophisticated:

| Pattern | Complexity | Best For |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| [Sequential Pipeline](#1-sequential-pipeline-claude--p) | Low | Daily dev steps, scripted workflows |
| [NanoClaw REPL](#2-nanoclaw-repl) | Low | Interactive persistent sessions |
| [Infinite Agentic Loop](#3-infinite-agentic-loop) | Medium | Parallel content generation, spec-driven work |
| [Continuous Claude PR Loop](#4-continuous-claude-pr-loop) | Medium | Multi-day iterative projects with CI gates |
| [De-Sloppify Pattern](#5-the-de-sloppify-pattern) | Add-on | Quality cleanup after any Implementer step |

### 1. Sequential Pipeline (`claude -p`)
### Core Insight
### Startup-config safety: add `--bare` in any checkout you do not control
### Untrusted / unattended: skip the checkout's startup surface entirely.
